# ScanToList
A project that adds scanned input to the list and to Viewstate. So that it is available for temporary view on the web homepage. 

In the project, EOLQA Master is the Masterpage and KennScanlocation.aspx has the webform created. It will accept the inputs into the list, save it into a viewstate and extract it onto the webpage after each load. Such that the entire scanned outputs are available on the screen.
